# you can use the underscore to separate zeros or any number

# Arithmetics: P E M D O S
# ** is for exponents
# even numbers have a remainder of 0
# odd numbers have a remainder of 1
# value += 3; this implies add value to 3 and update the value variable


# varibales; snake case is preferred, though camel case wont spil the code

# strings example:  name = "Delvin"
# strings are indexed : name[0] would output D
# name [-1] would output n
# string slicing; name [0:3] would output Del. index 3 is not inclusive

# None denoted a lack of a value: user = None
# type(None) would output NoneType  :)

# escape characters: \n for new line
# print("\\") two backslashes to print \

# tripple quoting:  ''' hello ''' or """Hello"""
# its normally used for multi line printing
# address = ''' name: Delvin Street
#               location: Ghana
# '''

# fucntions are reusable or repeatable actions that have a name
# in-built functions: len(), help(), input(), type(),
# we can also decide to do type casting: int(), str(), floot()
