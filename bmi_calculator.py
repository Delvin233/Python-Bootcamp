Create a simple script that calculates a userâ€™s body mass index.  

1. Prompt a user to enter their height (in inches) and their weight (in pounds).  
2. Next, calculate their BMI using the formula: **(weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches x height in inches)**
3. Output a message including their BMI number and category according to the following table:

> **< 16.0**    Severely Underweight 
**16.0 - 18.4**   Underweight
**18.5 - 24.9**   Normal
**25.0 - 29.9**   Overweight
**30.0 - 34.9**   Moderately Obese
**35.0 - 39.9**   Severely Obese
**> 39.9**   Morbidly Obese
